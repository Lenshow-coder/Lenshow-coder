Welcome to My Data Science Journey!

About Me

Hi! I'm Lenny, and I have made an ambitious decision to fully commit to learning Data Science. After discovering my passion for data while working as a Trader, I decided to quit my job to pursue Data Science full-time.

My Goals

Full-Time Learning: Iâ€™m dedicating myself to a self-structured learning path, focusing on essential skills like programming (Python, SQL), statistics, mathematics, and data visualization.

GitHub Progress Tracking: This GitHub profile will serve as my personal progress tracker. I'll be uploading learning materials, projects, and coding challenges as I advance.

Weekly Blog Posts: To hold myself accountable and maintain a record of my progress, I'll be posting a short blog entry every week documenting what I have learned.
